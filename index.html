        Who doesn't love going down the occasional random rabbit hole about some
        information that will likely never serve a use? I certainly do!
        Especially those within the absolute delight that is the website
        Wikipedia, which with their 6.8 million articles (in English alone), is
        a near endless trove of easily accessable knowledge. Thanks to the
        hyperlinks leading to other articles seamlessly incorporated into almost
        every article, letting you jump from read to read for hours on end,
        making Wikipedia a wonderful way to spend time going down a rabbit hole.
        Here is exactly where this blog comes into play, helping you get started
        down your dossier descent, with some handpicked articles that I
        personally find interesting.

        What better article to start off your rabbit hole journey than the
        ULTIMATE list of spoilers (that may or may not give you an existential
        crisis)? In my opinion, this is one of the most interesting reads on
        Wikipedia, and if you're interested in astrophysics, particle phyisics,
        evolutionary biology, sociology, or human technology/culture, you'll
        hopefully agree. Or maybe you or just want to know what'll happen in the
        countless millennia long after you've been forgotten. Either way, there
        are plenty of hyperlinks all throughout that will ensure an enjoyable
        rabbit-holing (especially if any of the previously mentioned fields are
        up your alley!)

        Paradoxes! These thought experiments can range from being a simple
        self-contradictory statement to confoundingly complex. Aside from being
        (occasionally) hard to understand, some of the articles written here are
        simply just interesting to read about. Although several of the paradoxes
        listed here have been disproved/have had solutions found, browsing
        through this list makes for a great way to spend some time and
        brainpower. These paradoxes span a multitude of subjects, covering areas
        such as logic, mathematics, physics, economics, and much more, and with
        340 different paradoxes, you're bound to come across one that you like,
        even if you hate thinking too hard.

        Cryptograms, especially ones that are unsolved, are always an extremely
        interesting read. Even since (at the very earliest) the (Minoan) Bronze
        Age, humans have been creating encrypted messages, with varying degrees
        of success. Some cryptograms, such as the Phiastos Disc from 2nd
        millennium BC have had their contents/meanings remain a mystery even
        until the modern day, 3 to 4 thousands of years since their initial
        creation. Others, such as Kyrptos, or the Zodiac Killer ciphers, have
        been created in the current century and have gained both fame and
        notoriety, especially because of the fact that they remain partially
        solved, meaning that the full deciphering of these cryptic messages are
        just out of reach. All in all, despite this being a shorter list, it is
        all an incredibly interesting read.

        When one hears the words "World of Warcraft", it should be safe to
        assume that the game has <em>NOT</em> had an impact as a research model
        for a disease outbreak used by the CDC and has <em>NOT</em> been
        compared to the COVID-19 pandemic, but BOTH these assumptions are WRONG
        somehow!!! Thanks to a software bug that slipped by Blizzard devs, an
        extremely deadly debuff given during a boss battle that should have been
        contained to <em>ONLY</em> that boss battle was able to spread to
        players beyond its intended reach, killing countless players and
        especially crippling densely populated non-combat zones. It got so bad,
        in fact, that Blizzard had to institute quarantine zones (which didn't
        work as they were bypassed), hotfixes (which <em>ALSO</em> didn't work),
        and eventually forced them to hard reset the WoW servers after a WEEK
        without finding a way to stop this virus. (Also, Mr. Whalen, I know you
        said you wouldn't read the wikipedia pages unfortunately but the
        comments on
        <a
          href="https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1105sm4/in_2005_world_of_warcraft_introduced_the/"
          >this link</a
        >) are great (plus deniz told me you love reddit (doubting you love that
        subreddit specifically but eh)). Despite its completely accidental
        nature, this incident bore several resemblances to real world pandemics,
        so much so that the CDC (not making this up) contacted Blizzard after
        the incident, asking if they could use data from what they saw as a
        "planned disease simulation" to aid their disease modeling research.
        Along with being compared to COVID-19 (with many similarities between
        what occured in game with the real world pandemic, such as impact on
        dense urban areas, first responders, and healthcare workers who were
        overrun with patients got infected themselves), Corrupted Blood has also
        been compared to avian influenza AND the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. It has
        also been considered as a model for bioterrorism research! Keep in mind
        this was all in WORLD OF WARCRAFT
