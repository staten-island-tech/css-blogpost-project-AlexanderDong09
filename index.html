        <h2>What <em>is</em> "Wikirabbithole" ?</h2>

      <p>
        Who doesn't love going down the occasional random rabbit hole about some
        information that will likely never serve a use? I certainly do!
        Especially those within the absolute delight that is the website
        Wikipedia, which with their 6.8 million articles (in English alone), is
        a near endless trove of easily accessable knowledge. Thanks to the
        hyperlinks leading to other articles seamlessly incorporated into almost
        every article, letting you jump from read to read for hours on end,
        making Wikipedia a wonderful way to spend time going down a rabbit hole.
        Here is exactly where this blog comes into play, helping you get started
        down your dossier descent, with some handpicked articles that I
        personally find interesting.
